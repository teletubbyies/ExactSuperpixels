# ExactSuperpixels
ExactSuperpixels is a Python library that provides precise control over superpixel segmentation in images. It extends the SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) algorithm to ensure an exact number of superpixels is generated, addressing a common limitation in standard implementations.
